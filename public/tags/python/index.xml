&lt;p&gt;When I first started getting into cybersecurity, I stumbled across the &lt;a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/"&gt;Pwnagotchi&lt;/a&gt;, a handheld device used for hacking that captures the 4 way handshake when some victim device connects to a wifi network. These captures can be analyzed and used to crack wifi passwords. I built one about a week later and fell in love with the form factor, the little avatar, and learning more about network security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1337ness</title><link>https://brohde.me/projects/1337ness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>bradinrohde0@gmail.com (Bradin Rohde)</author><guid>https://brohde.me/projects/1337ness/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After my very first CTF back in 2023, I was really interested in password cracking. It just makes you feel so powerful when hashcat comes back &amp;ldquo;Cracked&amp;rdquo;. With me being so new to password cracking and cybersecurity in general, I decided it would be worth writing a program that could help me crack more passwords. It would serve as a little project to learn shell scripting as well as some more python.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
