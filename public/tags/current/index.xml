&lt;p&gt;Before I became the TA for the Intro to Cybersecurity Course at Utah State, I helped out in the class as much as I could. Towards the end of the semester, the class was doing a Red vs Blue team tabletop simulation. It was pretty fun, and I found it to be a great learning tool for the students. However, it was done on pen and paper, and I thought it would be cool to automate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PwnHound</title><link>https://brohde.me/projects/pwnhound/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>bradinrohde0@gmail.com (Bradin Rohde)</author><guid>https://brohde.me/projects/pwnhound/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started getting into cybersecurity, I stumbled across the &lt;a href="https://pwnagotchi.ai/"&gt;Pwnagotchi&lt;/a&gt;, a handheld device used for hacking that captures the 4 way handshake when some victim device connects to a wifi network. These captures can be analyzed and used to crack wifi passwords. I built one about a week later and fell in love with the form factor, the little avatar, and learning more about network security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Homelab</title><link>https://brohde.me/projects/homelab/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>bradinrohde0@gmail.com (Bradin Rohde)</author><guid>https://brohde.me/projects/homelab/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Like every good network nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a homelab. From learning about firewall rules, to slapping an ungodly amount of raspberry pis together, the homelab is a great place to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBYd2mXIu6c"&gt;destroy, build, destroy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
