      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I became the TA for the Intro to Cybersecurity Course at Utah State, I helped out in the class as much as I could. Towards the end of the semester, the class was doing a Red vs Blue team tabletop simulation. It was pretty fun, and I found it to be a great learning tool for the students. However, it was done on pen and paper, and I thought it would be cool to automate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first started getting into cybersecurity, I stumbled across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://pwnagotchi.ai/&#34;&gt;Pwnagotchi&lt;/a&gt;, a handheld device used for hacking that captures the 4 way handshake when some victim device connects to a wifi network. These captures can be analyzed and used to crack wifi passwords. I built one about a week later and fell in love with the form factor, the little avatar, and learning more about network security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like every good network nerd, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a homelab. From learning about firewall rules, to slapping an ungodly amount of raspberry pis together, the homelab is a great place to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBYd2mXIu6c&#34;&gt;destroy, build, destroy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my very first CTF back in 2023, I was really interested in password cracking. It just makes you feel so powerful when hashcat comes back &amp;ldquo;Cracked&amp;rdquo;. With me being so new to password cracking and cybersecurity in general, I decided it would be worth writing a program that could help me crack more passwords. It would serve as a little project to learn shell scripting as well as some more python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
